3. Install dependencies:
    - Found in requirements.txt
4. Set up your MySQL database:
    - Ensure MySQL is installed on your system. Then import the provided EPL_dump.sql file:
    - mysql -u yourusername -p epl_database < EPL_dump.sql
5. Change app.py file to your SQL credentials 

## Frontend (iOS) Setup
